# Customizer Battery Box

This is a project designed for the Customizer tool of Thingiverse. The idea
being that I wanted a bunch of battery boxes that I could print for different
size and shape batteries and could print new boxes if I changed the number of
batteries that are important to me, the way I buy my batteries, etc.

So, that's what this does.
